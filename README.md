  ### Result And Findings
  -  The high attirion rate of male employee that left the organization could being for higher pay to meet family demands,
  -  Male are more likely tochange jobs because of
           -  they prioritize job offering superior benefits,
            -bonuses
            - inaddition to seeking better compensation to support themselvees and their families 
  -  inaddition a higher percentage of the males are single males and females
 - The single had the highest attrition rate (51%) more than fifty percent of total employee that left the organisation.
 - this could be due to the high flexibility to relocate, travel
  - Inaddition the singles do not have much faamily commitments
  - Result of R & D toping the attrition rate with 56% could be
           - lack of changing projects
           - Insufficient resources - poor funding, equipment
           - Bureaucratic slow decision making
- Sales department in next with 39%. the can be compensation or bounses to encourage employee retention
- The top 2 of the attrition by age range is 25-34 and 34-44. This is a very productive age. However this could be due to
- Lack of challenging assignment
- Uncleaar career path and Unfulfiing wwork
- Uncompetitive salary, no incentives, insufficient paid time off or leave
- where employee needs to get the best in career advancement
- It was observed that the attrition rate is not primarily due to job satisfaction for all Eductional fieldds as marketing with a high satisfaction count of 19 aganist 16 Disatisfaction still has an attrotion crate of 22%
Recommendations
- the conpany should consider employing famales because they are more stable on their jobs
- On the high attrition of singles, I will recommend the company to employ more married  personnel than singles to reduce the attrition rate
- The company need to conduct a survey to identify the cause of the high attrition rate by R&D department.
- Issues raised should be addressed accordingly as Research and Development department is key in  injecting fresh knowwledge in the process of running the organization
-  Introducing bounuses in sales department can also help to retain employee
-  To avoid the high attrition rate of age range 25-44 the following are recommenede
    - Have a flexible work arrangement
    - Professional development opportunities
    - Clear communication and feedback
    - Introduce recognition and reward programs
- The company should improve on the quality of care, working and environmental condition for personnel inoder to reduce attrition rate
